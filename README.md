# Python Group Project
Our Python Group Project is based on Data Analysis of Student Alcohol Consumption from a Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption.
We used Jupyter Notebook along with VSCode to write the project to find out how certain factors affected student alcohol consumption.

## Project Goal
Find out which factors affected alcohol consumption in students.

## Design Ideas

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository onto your machine.
2. Have Jupyter Notebook to run the code.
3. Make sure you have installed the packages listed in requirements.txt. Some parts of this code will not run correctly without them.
4. Make sure all of the files from the repository are in your machine. This includes the main code file along with the student-mat.csv file with the data set.
5. Run the program using run all.
